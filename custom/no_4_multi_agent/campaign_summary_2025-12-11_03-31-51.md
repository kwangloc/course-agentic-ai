# 🕶️ Summer Sunglasses Campaign – Executive Summary

## 📊 Refined Trend Insights
Executive Summary  
As we prepare to launch our Summer 2025 sunglasses campaign, three powerful style currents will define the season—and our core assortment of SKUs positions us to capture each one with maximum impact:

1. Statement-Tinted Lenses  
   • Why it matters: Bold colors and soft pastels are driving social buzz and broadening appeal beyond traditional sunglass shoppers.  
   • Product fit: SG005 “Round” (on-hand: 10 units) – Its minimalist circular frame becomes a canvas for eye-catching pastel gradients or dual-tone lenses, tapping directly into consumer desire for personalization and self-expression.

2. Sporty-Futuristic Shields  
   • Why it matters: Performance-inspired, single-lens shields with tech-driven details are migrating from athletic niches into mainstream streetwear.  
   • Product fit: SG004 “Sport” (on-hand: 11 units) – With its wraparound profile and rubberized temple grips, this model bridges functionality and fashion, appealing to the athleisure and urban markets alike.

3. Retro-Classic Revivals  
   • Why it matters: Timeless silhouettes (Aviator, Wayfarer, Cat-Eye) are experiencing a modern renaissance, fueled by oversized proportions, mixed materials and statement hardware.  
   • Product fit: SG001 “Aviator” (on-hand: 23 units) – The iconic teardrop shape enjoys renewed momentum; offered in classic smoke or new tinted finishes, it can be accessorized with a detachable chain for lifestyle differentiation.

Strategic Recommendations  
• Lead with “Round” in color-driven hero imagery—highlight pastel and gradient lens treatments across digital, social and in-store displays.  
• Showcase “Sport” in dynamic athletic and urban environments, underscoring its wind-protection and futuristic aesthetic in video and influencer content.  
• Position “Aviator” as the “everyday hero” style—feature both heritage (smoke lenses) and trend-forward (tint, chain accessory) executions to maximize cross-trend appeal.  

By centering our campaign on these three SKUs, we deliver a targeted yet diversified offering that speaks directly to summer’s most viral style moments—driving engagement, elevating brand perception and ultimately accelerating sell-through and margin performance.
