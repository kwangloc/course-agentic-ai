       "\n",
       "1. Top Trends Identified  \n",
       "   a. Colorful Tinted Lenses  \n",
       "      – From pastel gradients (millennial pink, lavender) to bold color-blocks, tinted lenses are one of summer’s biggest “statement” looks.  \n",
       "   b. Wraparound Shield/Sporty-Futuristic Frames  \n",
       "      – Single-lens, curved shields with “tech” vibes are crossing over from the track to streetwear.  \n",
       "   c. Retro-Classic Silhouettes Revival  \n",
       "      – Timeless shapes (Aviator, Wayfarer, Cat-Eye) are getting a ’90s/Y2K refresh with modern materials, oversized proportions or added hardware (chains, metal accents).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Catalog Products Aligned to These Trends  \n",
       "   – SG005 “Round” (Quantity 10)  \n",
       "     • Why it fits: Its minimalist, circular frame is a perfect canvas for summer’s colorful‐tint craze. Swapping in pastel or gradient lenses will instantly align the “Round” with the marquee tinted-lens trend.  \n",
       "   – SG004 “Sport” (Quantity 11)  \n",
       "     • Why it fits: The wraparound, single-lens construction and rubberized grips tick every box of the sporty-futuristic/shield trend. It’s a ready-to-wear statement for active, street-influenced wardrobes.  \n",
       "   – SG001 “Aviator” (Quantity 23)  \n",
       "     • Why it fits: The aviator’s teardrop shape is one of the strongest retro-classic revivals in 2025. Lightweight enough for all-day wear, it can be dressed up with a matching chain strap or offered with tinted‐lens options to bridge into the other two trends.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Campaign Recommendation  \n",
       "   • Feature “Round” with bold pastel and dual-tone lenses in lifestyle imagery to highlight the colorful-lens trend.  \n",
       "   • Promote “Sport” in athletic or urban settings—emphasize its wind-protective cover and futuristic look.  \n",
       "   • Position “Aviator” as the versatile “everyday hero” style, available in classic smoke or new tinted hues; consider styling it on models with a detachable chain for an easy accessory upgrade.\n",
       "\n",
       "Together, these three SKUs cover the season’s most buzzworthy directions—statement color, futuristic function, and the comfort of a classic silhouette—making them an ideal core assortment for your summer sunglasses campaign.</pre>\n",

       "1. Top Trends Identified  \n",
       "   a. Colorful Tinted Lenses  \n",
       "      – From pastel gradients (millennial pink, lavender) to bold color-blocks, tinted lenses are one of summer’s biggest “statement” looks.  \n",
       "   b. Wraparound Shield/Sporty-Futuristic Frames  \n",
       "      – Single-lens, curved shields with “tech” vibes are crossing over from the track to streetwear.  \n",
       "   c. Retro-Classic Silhouettes Revival  \n",
       "      – Timeless shapes (Aviator, Wayfarer, Cat-Eye) are getting a ’90s/Y2K refresh with modern materials, oversized proportions or added hardware (chains, metal accents).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Catalog Products Aligned to These Trends  \n",
       "   – SG005 “Round” (Quantity 10)  \n",
       "     • Why it fits: Its minimalist, circular frame is a perfect canvas for summer’s colorful‐tint craze. Swapping in pastel or gradient lenses will instantly align the “Round” with the marquee tinted-lens trend.  \n",
       "   – SG004 “Sport” (Quantity 11)  \n",
       "     • Why it fits: The wraparound, single-lens construction and rubberized grips tick every box of the sporty-futuristic/shield trend. It’s a ready-to-wear statement for active, street-influenced wardrobes.  \n",
       "   – SG001 “Aviator” (Quantity 23)  \n",
       "     • Why it fits: The aviator’s teardrop shape is one of the strongest retro-classic revivals in 2025. Lightweight enough for all-day wear, it can be dressed up with a matching chain strap or offered with tinted‐lens options to bridge into the other two trends.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Campaign Recommendation  \n",
       "   • Feature “Round” with bold pastel and dual-tone lenses in lifestyle imagery to highlight the colorful-lens trend.  \n",
       "   • Promote “Sport” in athletic or urban settings—emphasize its wind-protective cover and futuristic look.  \n",
       "   • Position “Aviator” as the versatile “everyday hero” style, available in classic smoke or new tinted hues; consider styling it on models with a detachable chain for an easy accessory upgrade.\n",

       "Together, these three SKUs cover the season’s most buzzworthy directions—statement color, futuristic function, and the comfort of a classic silhouette—making them an ideal core assortment for your summer sunglasses campaign.</pre>\n",

       "   • Product fit: SG005 “Round” (on-hand: 10 units) – Its minimalist circular frame becomes a canvas for eye-catching pastel gradients or dual-tone lenses, tapping directly into consumer desire for personalization and self-expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Sporty-Futuristic Shields  \n",
       "   • Why it matters: Performance-inspired, single-lens shields with tech-driven details are migrating from athletic niches into mainstream streetwear.  \n",
       "   • Product fit: SG004 “Sport” (on-hand: 11 units) – With its wraparound profile and rubberized temple grips, this model bridges functionality and fashion, appealing to the athleisure and urban markets alike.\n",

       "• Showcase “Sport” in dynamic athletic and urban environments, underscoring its wind-protection and futuristic aesthetic in video and influencer content.  \n",
